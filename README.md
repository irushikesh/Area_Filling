# Area_Filling
Python code for generation of area filling fractal

Algorithm: 
The algorithm used in this project is developed by C. Y. Wang and J.B. Bassingthwaighte. They have explained it in the paper "AREA-FILLING DISTRIBUTIVE NETWORK MODEL"

All the codes are written for area filling fractal which can fill any polygon.
Graphihcs.py developed by John Zelle is used in this project to draw the fractal.
